# AI-Based Learning-to-Job Skill Gap Prediction and Recommendation System

## Abstract
The AI-Based Learning-to-Job Skill Gap Prediction and Recommendation System is an intelligent career readiness platform designed to bridge the gap between academic learning outcomes and industry-driven job requirements. The system evaluates an individual’s skill profile against structured job role expectations, predicts job readiness levels using machine learning techniques, identifies critical skill gaps, and generates prioritized learning recommendations. By providing measurable, data-driven insights, the system enables learners to align their skill development with real-world employability requirements and supports informed career decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Despite completing formal education, many graduates face challenges in securing relevant employment due to a mismatch between acquired skills and industry expectations. Existing career guidance and learning platforms often provide generic assessments and unprioritized recommendations, failing to quantify job readiness or map skills to specific job roles. This project addresses these limitations by introducing a unified AI-based framework that objectively evaluates skill gaps and predicts job readiness in relation to targeted job roles.

## Key Objectives
- To assess learner competencies against job-specific skill requirements using structured and weighted evaluation methods  
- To predict job readiness levels through machine learning-based classification  
- To identify missing and weak skills with quantified gap analysis  
- To generate personalized and prioritized learning roadmaps aligned with industry relevance  
- To provide a transparent and interactive graphical interface for employability guidance  

---

## System Overview
The system integrates skill assessment, job role analysis, readiness prediction, and learning recommendation into a single end-to-end workflow. Learner skills are captured using standardized proficiency levels, while job roles are represented using a weighted skill framework that reflects industry importance. A skill gap analysis engine computes alignment scores, and a machine learning model predicts readiness levels such as Not Ready, Almost Ready, or Job Ready. Based on these results, the system generates a structured learning roadmap that prioritizes high-impact skills required for job readiness.

## Technical Approach
- Structured skill profiling for learners using predefined skill categories and proficiency levels  
- Weighted job role modeling to reflect real-world industry priorities  
- Skill gap computation through comparative analysis of learner skills and job role requirements  
- Machine learning-based job readiness prediction using supervised learning techniques  
- Rule-based and data-driven recommendation logic for prioritized learning paths  
- Visual dashboards to present readiness scores, skill gaps, and progress indicators
